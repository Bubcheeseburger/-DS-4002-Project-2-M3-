## ðŸ“Š Data Source

The dataset used in this project was obtained from the **[Harvard Dataverse - Five years of crowdsourced U.S. Amazon purchase histories with user demographic](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/YGLYDY&version=1.0)** page.  


### Included Files
- **`amazon-purchases.csv`** â€” Contains when and what purchases were made over the past five years 
- **`survey.csv`** â€” Contains survey results of users including their demographics

These files are going to be used to forcast what products are bought at what time in the year as well as classifying based on user demographics and time of year what that user would purchase next.
